# glue-zkb-test
This project is basically a way to learn AWS Glue & some rudimentary data processing applications on AWS.

I'm using EVE Online as a domain, specifically using the killstream from zKillboard's WebSocket interface.

From there, I aim to use Glue to transform the data and enrich it with more information, such as expanding IDs into names etc from the [SDE](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource)
